  # Connect to the configured ODBC DSN in the configuration file.
  # Execute a query (SELECT only) to the database to recover the number of pending transactions.
  # Compare the returned values with the thresholds defined by the command line parameters.
  # Returns to standard output a string in a format expected by Nagios
  # Based on the returned string Nagios server will proceed as configured.

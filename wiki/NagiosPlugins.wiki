= Introduction =

Nagios plug-ins are part of this project and they will be documented in this page.

== Siebel Components Monitoring ==

Currently there are two plug-ins for Nagios:

  * A plug-in to monitor Siebel components status in a Siebel Server
  * A plug-in to monitor Siebel Remote pending transactions threshold.

Both plug-ins must be integrated to Nagios using the default configuration methods. They can also be used as command lines tools, but using them with Nagios give much more features.

Below there are some screen-shots taken from the Nagios screens showing information generated by the plug-in in action.

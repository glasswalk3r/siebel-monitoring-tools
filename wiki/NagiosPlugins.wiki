#summary description of the Nagios plugins available

= Introduction =

Nagios plug-ins are part of this project and they will be documented in this page, regarding functionality and how to configure them.

== Siebel Components Monitoring ==

This is the first released plug-in for Nagios: the components of a Siebel server can be monitored by it. The plug-in will work execute the following operations in sequence after is invoked by Nagios (directly or indirectly):

  # read a XML configuration file;
  # connect to the Siebel server with `srvrmgr` program;
  # list all components configured in the Server;
  # compare the components states with the expected ones read from the XML configuration file;
  # return the comparison as a format understood by Nagios;

=== Configuration ===

The configuration file looks like this:

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<servers>
  <server name="foobar">
    <components>
      <component name="TxnProc" description="Transaction Processor" ComponentGroup="Remote" OKStatus="Executing" criticality="5"/>
      <component name="WorkActn" description="Workflow Action Agent" ComponentGroup="Workflow" criticality="1"/>
      <component name="WorkMon" description="Workflow Monitor Agent" ComponentGroup="Workflow" criticality="1"/>
      <component name="WfProcBatchMgr" description="Workflow Process Batch Manager" ComponentGroup="Workflow" criticality="1"/>
      <component name="WfProcMgr" description="Workflow Process Manager" ComponentGroup="Workflow" criticality="5"/>
    </components>
    <componentsGroups>
      <componentGroup name="Workflow" defaultOKStatus="Executing|Activated"/>
    </componentsGroups>
  </server>
</servers>
}}}

Each component description includes:

  * name: the component alias, as retrieve from `list comp` command on `srvrmgr`;
  * description: the description field from `list comp` command on `srvrmgr`;
  * OKStatus: the expected status for the component, as returned by the `list comp` command. It is possible to include multiple values, separated by a pipe character ("|");
  * !ComponentGroup: the component group that the component is part of, as from `list comp` command on `srvrmgr`. This configuration is optional and may be used as a shortcut to identify globally which are the expected status for the component;
  * criticality: a integer value that identifies how much it is critical for the server if the component does not have the expected status. This value will be used to calculate the threshold of the plug-in to issue a _WARNING_ or a _CRITICAL_ in Nagios.

You can create as many as necessary components definitions in the XML file.

Below there are some screen-shots taken from the Nagios screens showing information generated by the plug-in.

= Introduction =

The Siebel-Srvrmgr-Exporter is another proof of concept of usage of the Siebel-Srvrmgr API.

Siebel-Srvrmgr-Exporter is a Perl distribution itself, and it provides a program that connects to a Siebel Server, recover all information regarding the components available in the server and "dump" their information to standard output in the form of `create component` commands to be executed in `srvrmgr` program itself.

This is quite handy if you need to migrate customized components from an environment to another since doing it manually means a *lot* of typing.

A result of a running session, using all recovered parameters *with values* from the Siebel components that matches the regular expression given. Please notice that the generated output is considerable shorter than exporting all parameters:

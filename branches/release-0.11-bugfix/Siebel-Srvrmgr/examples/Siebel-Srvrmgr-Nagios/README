README
----------------
These files are a complete Nagios plugin for setup Siebel components monitoring:

- commands.cfg: this file is the Nagios commands configuration file. It contains an example of how the comp_mon.pl should be executed
- comp_mon.pl: this Perl script is the main part of the Nagios Plugin.
- comp_mon.xml: this is the XML file used to configure which Siebel Server and corresponding modules should be monitored
- comp_mon.xsd: the XML Schema to validate comp_mon.xml, if necessary
- NSC.ini: this is an example of NSC client used to monitor the components. The NSC must be installed in a Windows computer
that has the srvrmgr.exe program installed, since comp_mon.pl will use such program to connect to a Siebel Server.

The NSC is not obligatory, but you will need to have srvrmgr program available somewhere (even in the Nagios box) to check the components.

Beware that even that the XML and XML Schema files and the current API permits to configure multiple Siebel Servers, the program comp_mon.pl expects
to use a single Siebel Server in a Siebel Enterprise to monitor: the reason for this is to give at least some more detail if something goes bad in some
components since at least the problem will be detected in a specific Siebel Server.

See www.nagios.org for more information about the Nagios project.

=head1 NAME

Siebel::Srvrmgr::Nagios - Perl extension for monitoring Siebel environment with Nagios

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Siebel::Srvrmgr::Nagios is only Pod about the distribution.

This distribution includes Perl modules based on L<Siebel::Srvrmgr> API to build a functional Nagios plugin to monitor Siebel Server components.

The distribution itself was created to make it easier to setup the Nagios plugin.

The plugin works by executing C<list comp> commands to a Siebel server, recovering the componentes status and comparing them to a existing list that
have the "expected" (a status that does not indicate an error) for each one of the components available in the server. The rest (the return result)
is given to Nagios for interpretation and everything else is done by Nagios itself.

Please see the README file for details of the files that are part of this distribution.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.

=head1 CAVEATS

Since this is a proof of concept, the plugin was not optimized for production systems: probably the plugin uses more memory than it is really necessary.

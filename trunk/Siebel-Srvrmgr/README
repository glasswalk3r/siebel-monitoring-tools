Siebel-Srvrmgr
=====================

This distribution is part of the project Siebel Monitoring Tools.

The goal of this project is to make possible to monitor Siebel servers through SNMP. 

The object that are being considered to be monitored are: components status, resource consumption and tasks information. 

This distribution was created to enable facilities like:

- execute the srvrmgr program and read it's output without depending on batch mode and reconnecting for each command.
- parse output of commands from srvrmgr as a general purpouse tools.

With those tools available it would be able to execute commmands through srvrmgr program and populate an database (for this project, an SNMP MIB).

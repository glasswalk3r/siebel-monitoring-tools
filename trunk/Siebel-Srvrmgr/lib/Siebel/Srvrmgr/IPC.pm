=head1 NAME

Siebel::Srvrmgr::Daemon - IPC functionality for Siebel::Srvrmgr classes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Siebel::Srvrmgr::IPC qw(safe_open3);

	my ( $pid, $write_h, $read_h, $error_h ) = safe_open3( \@params );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exports a single function (C<safe_open3>) used for running a external program, reading it's STDOUT, STDERR and writing to STDIN by
using IPC.

This module is based on L<IPC::Open3::Callback> from Lucas Theisen (see SEE ALSO section).

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 safe_open3

C<safe_open3> functions executes a "safe" version of L<IPC::Open3> that will execute additional processing required for using C<select> in Microsoft
Windows OS (if automatically detected). For other OS's, the default functionality of L<IPC::Open3> is used.

Expects as parameter an array reference with the external program to execute, including the arguments for it.

Returns (in this order):

=over

=item 1.

The PID of the child process executing the external program.

=item 2.

The writer handle to the child process.

=item 3.

The reader handle to the child process.

=item 4.

The error handle for the child process.

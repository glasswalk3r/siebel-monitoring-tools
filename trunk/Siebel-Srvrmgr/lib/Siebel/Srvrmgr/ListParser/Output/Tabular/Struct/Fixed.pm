=head1 NAME

Siebel::Srvrmgr::ListParser::Output::Tabular::Struct::Fixed - subclass to parse fixed width output from srvrmgr

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is a subclass of L<Siebel::Srvrmgr::ListParser::Output::Tabular::Struct> to parse fixed width output from C<srvrmgr>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 fields_pattern

This is a read-only attribute which is defined internally by invoking the C<define_fields_pattern> method during parsing execution.

It is a string representing the pattern of the fields to be used with C<unpack> function.

=cut

has fields_pattern => (
    is     => 'ro',
    isa    => 'Str',
    reader => 'get_fields_pattern',
    writer => '_set_fields_pattern'
);

sub _build_col_sep {

    my $self = shift;
    $self->_set_col_sep('\s{2,}');

}

=pod

=head1 METHODS

=head2 define_fields_pattern

Overrided from the parent class.

Based on the first two rows of a C<srvrmgr> output with fixed width format, it will define
the fields pattern to be used with C<unpack> to retrieve the fields values.

Expects the "------------" line under the header with the fields names.

=cut

sub define_fields_pattern {

    my $self = shift;
    my $line = shift;

    my $separator = $self->get_col_sep();
    my $comp_sep  = qr/$separator/;

    # :TODO:30-12-2013:: some logging would ne nice here
    if ( $line =~ $comp_sep ) {

        my @columns = split( /$separator/, $line );

        my $pattern;

        foreach my $column (@columns) {

# :WARNING   :09/05/2013 12:19:37:: + 2 because of the spaces after the "---" that will be trimmed
            $pattern .= 'A' . ( length($column) + 2 );

        }

        $self->_set_fields_pattern($pattern);
        return 1;

    }
    else {

        return 0;

    }

}

=pod

=head2 get_fields

Overrided from parent class.

Returns the fields values as an array reference.

Expects a string with fields values to be parsed.

=cut

sub get_fields {

    my $self = shift;
    my $line = shift;

    if ( defined( $self->get_fields_pattern() ) ) {

        my @fields = unpack( $self->get_fields_pattern(), $line );

        return \@fields;

    }
    else {

        confess 'cannot procede without fields_pattern being defined first';

    }

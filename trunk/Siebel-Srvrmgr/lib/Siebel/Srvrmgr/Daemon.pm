=head1 NAME

Siebel::Srvrmgr::Daemon - super class for sessions with Siebel srvrmgr program

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyDaemon;

	extends 'Siebel::Srvrmgr::Daemon';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a super class, and alone it does not provide any functionaly to use srvrmgr to send commands and process returned data.

The "private" method C<_setup_commands> must be overrided by subclasses of it or commands will not be sent to srvrmgr (the currently implementation C<warn>s 
about that). 

Logging of this class can be enabled by using L<Siebel::Srvrmgr> logging feature.

The logic behind this class is easy: you can submit a pair of command/action to the class. It will then connect to the server by executing C<srvrmgr>, submit the command 
to the server and recover the output generated. The action will be executed having this output as parameter. Anything could be considered as an action, from simple 
storing the output to even generating new commands to be executed in the server.

A command is an instance of L<Siebel::Srvrmgr::Daemon::Command> class. Any "list" command is supported, and also C<load preferences> and C<exit>. Anything else
is considered dangerous and will generated an exception. Beware that you will need to have an L<Siebel::Srvrmgr::ListParser::Output> class available to be 
able to parse the command output.

An action can be any class but is obligatory to create a subclass of L<Siebel::Srvrmgr::Daemon::Action> base class. See the <commands>
attribute for details.

Implementation details are reserved to subclasses of Siebel::Srvrmgr::Daemon: be sure to check them for real usage cenarios.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 server

This is a string representing the servername where the instance should connect. This is a optional attribute during
object creation with the C<new> method.

Beware that the C<run> method will verify if the C<server> attribute has a defined value or not: if it has, the C<run>
method will try to connect to the Siebel Enterprise specifying the given Siebel Server. If not, the method will try to connect
to the Enterprise only, not specifying which Siebel Server to connect.

=cut

has server => (
    isa      => 'NotNullStr',
    is       => 'rw',
    required => 0,
    reader   => 'get_server',
    writer   => 'set_server'
);

=head2 gateway

This is a string representing the gateway where the instance should connect. This is a required attribute during
object creation with the C<new> method.

=cut

has gateway => (
    isa      => 'NotNullStr',

    required => 1,
    reader   => 'get_gateway',
    writer   => 'set_gateway'
);

=head2 enterprise

This is a string representing the enterprise where the instance should connect. This is a required attribute during
object creation with the C<new> method.

);

=head2 user

This is a string representing the login for authentication. This is a required attribute during
object creation with the C<new> method.

=cut

has user => (
    isa      => 'NotNullStr',
    is       => 'rw',
    required => 1,
    reader   => 'get_user',

    is       => 'rw',
    required => 1,
    reader   => 'get_password',
    writer   => 'set_password'
);

=head2 commands

An array reference containing one or more references of L<Siebel::Srvrmgr::Daemon::Commands> class.

The commands will be executed in the exactly order as given by the indexes in the array reference (as FIFO).

This is a required attribute during object creation with the C<new> method.

=cut

has commands => (
    isa      => 'ArrayRef[Siebel::Srvrmgr::Daemon::Command]',
    is       => 'rw',

This is a required attribute during object creation with the C<new> method.

=cut

has bin => (
    isa      => 'NotNullStr',
    is       => 'rw',
    required => 1,
    reader   => 'get_bin',

);

=pod

=head2 is_infinite

An boolean defining if the interaction loop should be infinite or not.

=cut

has is_infinite => ( isa => 'Bool', is => 'ro', default => sub { 0 } );

=pod

=head2 alarm_timeout

The an integer value that will raise an ALARM signal generated by C<alarm>. The default value is 30 seconds.

Besides C<read_timeout>, this will raise an exception and exit the read loop from srvrmgr in cases were an output cannot be retrieved.

This attribute will be reset every time a read can be done from the STDOUT or STDERR from srvrmgr.

=cut

has alarm_timeout => (
    is      => 'Int',
    is      => 'rw',
    writer  => 'set_alarm',
    reader  => 'get_alarm',
    default => 30
);

=pod

=head2 use_perl

A boolean attribute used mostly for testing of this class.

If true, if will prepend the complete path of the Perl interpreter to the parameters before calling the C<srvrmgr> program (of course the "srvrmgr" must
be itself a Perl script).

It defaults to false.

=cut

has use_perl =>
  ( isa => 'Bool', is => 'ro', reader => 'use_perl', default => 0 );

=head2 lang_id

A string representing the LANG_ID parameter to connect to srvrmgr. If defaults to "ENU";

=cut

has lang_id => (
    isa     => 'Str',
    is      => 'rw',
    reader  => 'get_lang_id',
    writer  => 'set_lang_id',
    default => 'ENU'
);

=head2 child_runs

An integer representing the number of times the child object was used in C<run> invocations. This is reset to zero if a new child process is created.

=cut

has child_runs => (
    isa     => 'Int',
    is      => 'ro',
    reader  => 'get_child_runs',
    writer  => '_set_child_runs',
    default => 0
);

=head2 maximum_retries

The maximum times this class wil retry to launch a new process of srvrmgr if the previous one failed for any reason. This is intented to implement
robustness to the process.

=cut

has maximum_retries => (
    isa     => 'Int',
    is      => 'ro',
    reader  => 'get_max_retries',
    writer  => '_set_max_retries',
    default => 5
);

=head2 retries

The number of retries of launching a new srvrmgr process. If this value reaches the value defined for C<maximum_retries>, the instance of Siebel::Srvrmgr::Daemon
will quit execution returning an error code.

=cut

has retries => (
    isa     => 'Int',
    is      => 'ro',
    reader  => 'get_retries',
    writer  => '_set_retries',
    default => 0
);

=head2 clear_raw

A boolean attribute that defines if the raw data recovered from C<srvrmgr> should be kept or discarded as soon as possibly.

Having a default value of true, it should help reducing memory usage or debugging, if set false.

=cut

has clear_raw => (
    is      => 'rw',
    isa     => 'Bool',
    reader  => 'clear_raw',
    writer  => 'set_clear_raw',
    default => 1
);

=head2 field_delimiter

This is a single character attribute. It tells the Daemon class to consider a field delimiter, if such options was
set in the C<srvrmgr> program. If this option is used but this attribute is not set accordinly, parsing will probably
fail.

Since this attribute should be defined during Daemon object instance, it is read-only.

=cut

has field_delimiter => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Chr', reader => 'get_field_del' );

has has_lock => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Bool', default => 0 );

=pod

command left (which is not C<shift>ed).

This method is useful specially if the Daemon will keep executing commands, but setup commands (like C<load preferences>) are not necessary to be executed
again.

=head2 run

=head2 DEMOLISH

This method is invoked before the object instance is destroyed. It does really few things like writting messages to the define configuration of
L<Log::Log4perl> logger. It will also log if ALRM, INT or PIPE signals were received.

Subclasses may want to C<override> the method "private" C<_my_cleanup> to do their properly laundry since the definition of C<_my_cleanup> for this class 
is just to C<return> true. C<_my_cleanup> is called with a reference of a L<Log::Log4perl::Logger> instance for usage.

=head1 NAME

Siebel::Srvrmgr - utilities to be used with the Siebel srvrmgr program

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The distribution Siebel-Srvrmgr was created to define a set of tools to interact with the C<srvrmgr> program from Siebel.

It was started initially to create a parser for the project Siebel Monitoring Tools (L<http://code.google.com/p/siebel-monitoring-tools/>) and later was grown to a 
set of more generic functionality, thus making sense to be published at CPAN.

This package used to be only Pod, but since release 0.09 it has a logging feature. See logging_cfg for details.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 logging_cfg

Returns a string with the configuration to be used by a L<Log::Log4perl> instance.

The configuration of L<Log::Log4perl> is available after the C<__DATA__> code block of this package. Logging is disabled by default, but can be enabled by
only commenting the line:

    log4perl.threshold = OFF

with the default "#" Perl comment character.

Logging is quite flexible (see L<Log::Log4Perl> for details) but the default configuration uses only DEBUG level printing messages to STDOUT.

=head1 SEE ALSO

The classes below might give you a introduction of the available classes and features.

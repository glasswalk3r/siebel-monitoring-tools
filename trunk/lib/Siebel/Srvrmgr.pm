=head1 NAME

Siebel::Srvrmgr - utilities to be used with the Siebel srvrmgr program

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package is only Pod, no code is available from here.

The distribution Siebel-Srvrmgr was created to define a set of tools to interact with the C<srvrmgr> program from Siebel.

It was started initially to create a parser for the project Siebel Monitoring Tools (L<< http://code.google.com/p/siebel-monitoring-tools/ >>) and latter was grown to a set of more generic functionality, thus
making sense to be published at CPAN.

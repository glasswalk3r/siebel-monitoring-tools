=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Siebel::Srvrmgr::ListParser::Output::ListComp::Comp;

	my $comp = Siebel::Srvrmgr::ListParser::Output::ListComp::Comp->new({ data => \%data,  cc_alias => 'MyComp' });

	print 'NAME = ', $comp->cc_name(), "\n";

	foreach my $param(@{$comp->get_params()}) {

		print $comp->get_param_val($param), "\n";
		
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is meant to be used together with L<Siebel::Srvrmgr::ListParser::Output::Server> since a component is always associated with a Siebel server. It make it easy to
access and modify components as desired (for example, to export all components from one server to another changing some of their parameters).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Beware that some of the attributes of the component may reflect only the current state when the component data was recovered and are, by nature, dinamic. Some example are
the number of running tasks and state of the component.

=head2 data

A hash reference with the data of the component. The expected structure of the hash reference is the same one provided by the method C<get_comp> of the class
L<Siebel::Srvrmgr::ListParser::Output::Server>.

This is a required attribute during object creation.

=cut

has data => (
    isa      => 'HashRef',
    is       => 'ro',
    required => 1,
    reader   => 'get_data',
    writer   => '_set_data'
);

=pod

=head2 cc_alias

A string of the alias of the component.

This is a required attribute during object creation.

=cut

has cc_alias => ( isa => 'Str', is => 'rw', required => 1 );

=head2 cc_name

A string of the name of the component.

=cut

has cc_name => ( isa => 'Str', is => 'rw' );

=pod

=head2 cp_max_tasks

=head1 METHODS

All attributes have the same methods name to access them. For setting them, just invoke the method name with the desirable value as parameter.

=head2 BUILD

The C<BUILD> method will create all attributes/methods based on the value of the C<data> attribute.

Once this operation is finished, the C<data> attribute is set to an empty hash reference.

=cut

sub BUILD {

    my $self = shift;

    my @rw = qw(cc_name ct_alias cg_alias cc_runmode cp_max_tasks cc_desc_text);

    foreach my $attrib (@rw) {

        my $key = uc($attrib);

        $self->$attrib( $self->get_data()->{$key} )
          if ( exists( $self->get_data()->{$key} ) );

    }

    my @ro_str = qw(cp_disp_run_state cp_start_time cp_end_time cp_status);

    foreach my $attrib (@ro_str) {

        $self->$method( $self->get_data()->{$key} )
          if ( exists( $self->get_data()->{$key} ) );

    }

          ? $self->cp_max_mts_procs(0)
          : $self->cp_max_mts_procs( $self->get_data()->{$key} );

    }
    else {

        die "Cannot find $key in data attribute";

    }

    my @ro_int = qw(cp_num_run_tasks cp_actv_mts_procs cc_incarn_no);

    foreach my $attrib (@ro_int) {

        my $key = uc($attrib);

        my $method = "_set_$attrib";

        if ( exists( $self->get_data()->{$key} ) ) {

            ( $self->get_data()->{$key} eq '' )
              ? $self->$method(0)
              : $self->$method( $self->get_data()->{$key} );

        }
        else {

            die "Cannot find $key in data attribute";

        }
    }

    $self->_set_data( {} );

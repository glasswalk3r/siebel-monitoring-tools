=head1 METHODS

=head2 create

Expects as parameter the name of the class that needs to be instantiated followed by any required parameters for the class to 
instantiate a new object. It returns the instantiated object, if possible, otherwise it will raise an exception.

If a single string (without double semicolon separators) is given as the class name, ActionFactory will understand that it will
have to expand it to a full Action subclass name available from this distribution. For example, if a "LoadPrefences" is given it
will be expanded to "Siebel::Srvrmgr::Daemon::Action::LoadPreferences" and try to instantiate such object.

If a full class name (with double semicolon separators) is given, the factory will try to instantiate that object and return it. That should
make possible to create objects from classes outside the distribution directory.

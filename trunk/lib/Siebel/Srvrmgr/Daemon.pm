=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to execute the C<srvrmgr> program and execute commands through it.

The sessions are not "interactive" from the user point of view but the usage of this class enable the adoption of some logic to change how the commands will be executed or
even generate commands on the fly.

The logic behind this class is easy: you can submit a pair of command/action to the class. It will then connect to the server by executing C<srvrmgr>, submit the command to the server
and recover the output generated. The action will be executed having this output as parameter. Anything could be considered as an action, from simple storing the output to even generating
new commands to be executed in the server.

A command is any command supported from C<srvrmgr> program. An action can be any class but is obligatory to create a subclass of L<Siebel::Srvrmgr::Daemon::Action> base class. See the <commands>
attribute for details.

The object will create an loop to interact with the C<srvrmgr> program to execute the commands and actions as requested. This loop might be infinite, where the C<commands> attribute will be restarted when the
stack is finished.

The C<srvrmgr> program will be executed by using IPC: this means that this method should be portable. Once the connection is made (see the C<run> method) it will not be dropped after commands execution but it will
be done automatically when the instance of this class goes out of scope. The instance is also able to deal with C<INT> signal and close connection as appropriate: the class will first try to submit a C<exit> command
through C<srvrmgr> program and if it's not terminated automatically the PID will be ripped.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 server

This is a string representing the servername where the instance should connect. This is a optional attribute during
object creation with the C<new> method.

Beware that the C<run> method will verify if the C<server> attribute has a defined value or not: if it has, the C<run>
method will try to connect to the Siebel Enterprise specifying the given Siebel Server. If not, the method will try to connect
to the Enterprise only, not specifying which Siebel Server to connect.

=cut

has server => (
    isa      => 'Str',
    is       => 'rw',
    required => 0,
    reader   => 'get_server',
    writer   => 'set_server'
);

=head2 gateway

This is a string representing the gateway where the instance should connect. This is a required attribute during
object creation with the C<new> method.

=cut

has gateway => (
    isa      => 'Str',
    is       => 'rw',
    required => 1,
    reader   => 'get_gateway',
    writer   => 'set_gateway'
);

=head2 enterprise

This is a string representing the enterprise where the instance should connect. This is a required attribute during
object creation with the C<new> method.

=cut

has enterprise => (
    isa      => 'Str',
    is       => 'rw',
    required => 1,
    reader   => 'get_enterprise',
    writer   => 'set_enterprise'
);

=head2 user

This is a string representing the login for authentication. This is a required attribute during
object creation with the C<new> method.

=cut

has user => (
    isa      => 'Str',
    is       => 'rw',
    required => 1,
    reader   => 'get_user',
    writer   => 'set_user'
);

=head2 password

This is a string representing the password for authentication. This is a required attribute during
object creation with the C<new> method.

=cut

has password => (
    isa      => 'Str',
    is       => 'rw',
    required => 1,
    reader   => 'get_password',
    writer   => 'set_password'
);

=head2 wait_time

This represent the time that the instance should wait after submitting a command to the server.

The time value is an integer in seconds. The default value is 1 second.

This should help with servers that are slow to giving a reply after a command submitted and avoid errors while
trying to process generated output.

=cut

has wait_time => (
    isa     => 'Int',
    is      => 'rw',
    default => 1,
    reader  => 'get_wait_time',
    writer  => 'set_wait_time'
);

=head2 commands

An array reference containing hash references with the keys C<command> and C<action>. The C<command> key should have the 
command to be executed and the C<action> key the name of the class to be instantied as an action to be executed.

The commands will be executed in the exactly order as given by the indexes in the array reference (as FIFO).

The C<action> key value could be the full package name of the class or only the class name of a subclass from L<Siebel::Srvrmgr::Daemon::Action> (consider this as a shortcut).

Additionally, the optional key C<params> might by used to pass parameters to the class given by the C<action> key. The content of such key must be an array reference, which in case will make it 
possible to pass an arbitrary number of the parameters to the class. How the action class will deal with the parameters is left to the class.

This is a required attribute during object creation with the C<new> method.

=cut

has commands => (
    isa      => 'ArrayRef',
    is       => 'rw',
    required => 1,
    reader   => 'get_commands',
    writer   => 'set_commands'
);

=pod

=head2 bin

An string representing the full path to the C<srvrmgr> program in the filesystem.

This is a required attribute during object creation with the C<new> method.

=cut

has bin => (
    isa      => 'Str',
    is       => 'rw',
    required => 1,
    reader   => 'get_bin',
    writer   => 'set_bin'
);

=pod

=head2 write_fh

=head2 last_exec_cmd

This is a string representing the last command submitted to the C<srvrmgr> program. The default value for it is an
empty string (meaning that no command was submitted yet).

=cut

has last_exec_cmd => (
    isa     => 'Str',
    is      => 'ro',
    default => '',
    reader  => 'get_last_cmd',
    writer  => '_set_last_cmd'
);

=pod

=head2 cmd_stack

This is an array reference with the stack of commands to be executed. It is maintained automatically by the class, so the attribute is read-only.

    isa    => 'ArrayRef',
    is     => 'ro',
    writer => '_set_cmd_stack',
    reader => 'get_cmd_stack'

=head2 DEMOLISH

This method is invoked before the object instance is destroyed. It will try to close the connection with the Siebel Enterprise (if opened)
by submitting the command C<exit>.

It will then try to read the string "Disconnecting from server" from the generated output after the command submission and closing the opened
filehandles right after. Then it will send a C<kill 0> signal to the process to check if it is still running.

Finally, it will wait for 5 seconds before calling C<waitpid> function to rip the child process.

=head1 CAVEATS

This class is still considered experimental and should be used with care.

The C<srvrmgr> program uses buffering, which makes difficult to read the generated output as expected.

The C<open2> function in Win32 system is still returnin a PID even when an error occurs when executing the C<srvrmgr> program.

L<IPC::Cmd> looks like to a portable solution for those problems but that was not tested till now.

# Contributing for the project

Project contribution is not just code! There is need for testing, reporting bugs, asking for features and even documentation. Feel free to contact the project owner for details if you would like to join the project.

Currently, there is a important area to help that is provide output from different Siebel versions from the `srvrmgr`. This task is **very** easy to accomplish and it will help improve the parsers from the currently API. If you like to help, please check the wiki SrvrmgrOutput for more details.

If coding is your area, please see DeveloperNotes for details about helping developing the project.

This project has a wiki, with specific sections dedicated to help you to contribute to this project:

* [How to fetch srvrmgr output](https://github.com/glasswalk3r/siebel-monitoring-tools/wiki/SrvrmgrOutput)
* [How to setup your environment before starting](https://github.com/glasswalk3r/siebel-monitoring-tools/wiki/DeveloperNotes)
